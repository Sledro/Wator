# Solution

We decided to use the OpenGL Graphics Library as its cross-platform and lightweight. We used FreeGLUT as the The OpenGL Utility and we used GLEW as the extension wrangler for FreeGLUT to allow us to use FreeGlut easier.

To install OpenGL GLUT and GLUT on UBUNTU:

FreeGLUT – http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/
GLEW – http://glew.sourceforge.net/

Copy Glut includes/GL to usr/includes/

Open Glew download folder in terminal and enter $ sudo make install
