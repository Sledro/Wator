Problem:

Re-create the famous Wa-Tor program in Serial C++

Notes we made:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1msy3tMwwZEYYBn2fGaV15tsMR2cHHrmowIBlJAE9KSo/edit?usp=sharing

We decided to use the SFML graphics library over just OpenGL alone as it gives more options.

To install SFML on UBUNTU:

sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev

Download SFML, Open the downloaded directory in terminal, enter:

$ sudo cp -r include/SFML /usr/include
$ sudo cp -r /lib/* /usr/lib
$ sudo cp -r share/SFML /usr/share

This will add the libraries to your HDD and allow you to comiple the Wator program.
